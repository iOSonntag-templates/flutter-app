# flutter-mac-switch
A simple tool to backup the things iCloud does not catch.


## WARNING:
- this flutter application is meant for private purposes only (at least for the moment) 
- it is heavy under
development, do not expect it to work - you might loose all your data if you
still use it
- it is public so others can benefit from my development

I will update the `README.md` once I feel I have something stable.
